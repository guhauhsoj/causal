# causal

This is the code for all of the analysis for the STA256, Causal inference final project done by Matthew Martinez and Joshua Hug. The code is designed to be entirely self contained and replicable. Therefore we have included the data within the repository. The data sources are https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/usaleep/usaleep.html#life-expectancy for the US_A.zip file, which contains life expectancy information for the census tracts in the United States. The other source is https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/project/101441/version/V1/view;jsessionid=D26A495DADA2F5344196551FDC419E79, which is USDA data on demographic information about census tracts. 

The format of the analysis is as follows, the analysis.Rmd file contains all of the code necessary for analysis and imports all the functions needed from the functions.R file (Thanks to Professor Ding for providing most of the functions from his lecture notes!). The cleaning.R file cleans the data for the correct format needed. All chunks in the analysis.rmd file can be run by themselves **after** the first chunk is run. So any method can be replicated by running the first chunk then running the chunk with the desired analysis.
